## üíø Install

Set up your project using your preferred package manager. Use the corresponding command to install the dependencies:

| Package Manager                                                | Command        |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started)                   | `yarn install` |

## üí° Usage

This section covers how to start the development server and build your project for production.

### Starting the Development Server

To start the development server with hot-reload, run the following command. The server will be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000):

```bash
yarn dev
```

(Repeat for npm, pnpm, and bun with respective commands.)

> Add NODE_OPTIONS='--no-warnings' to suppress the JSON import warnings that happen as part of the Vuetify import mapping. If you are on Node [v21.3.0](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v21.3.0) or higher, you can change this to NODE_OPTIONS='--disable-warning=5401'. If you don't mind the warning, you can remove this from your package.json dev script.

### Building for Production

To build your project for production, use:

```bash
yarn build
```

(Repeat for npm, pnpm, and bun with respective commands.)

Once the build process is completed, your application will be ready for deployment in a production environment.

## The node.js example app

[![CircleCI](https://img.shields.io/circleci/project/github/contentful/the-example-app.nodejs.svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/contentful/the-example-app.nodejs)

The node.js example app teaches the very basics of how to work with Contentful:

- consume content from the Contentful Delivery and Preview APIs
- model content
- edit content through the Contentful web app

The app demonstrates how decoupling content from its presentation enables greater flexibility and facilitates shipping higher quality software more quickly.

<a href="https://the-example-app-nodejs.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank"><img src="https://images.contentful.com/qz0n5cdakyl9/4GZmvrdodGM6CksMCkkAEq/700a527b8203d4d3ccd3c303c5b3e2aa/the-example-app.png" alt="Screenshot of the example app"/></a>

You can see a hosted version of `The node.js example app` on <a href="https://the-example-app-nodejs.contentful.com/" target="_blank">Heroku</a>.

## What is Contentful?

[Contentful](https://www.contentful.com) provides a content infrastructure for digital teams to power content in websites, apps, and devices. Unlike a CMS, Contentful was built to integrate with the modern software stack. It offers a central hub for structured content, powerful management and delivery APIs, and a customizable web app that enable developers and content creators to ship digital products faster.

## Requirements

* Node 8
* Git
* Contentful CLI (only for write access)

Without any changes, this app is connected to a Contentful space with read-only access. To experience the full end-to-end Contentful experience, you need to connect the app to a Contentful space with read _and_ write access. This enables you to see how content editing in the Contentful web app works and how content changes propagate to this app.

## Common setup

Clone the repo and install the dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/contentful/the-example-app.nodejs.git
cd the-example-app.nodejs
```

```bash
npm install
```

## Steps for read-only access

To start the express server, run the following

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and take a look around.


## Steps for read and write access (recommended)

Step 1: Install the [Contentful CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/contentful-cli)

Step 2: Login to Contentful through the CLI. It will help you to create a [free account](https://www.contentful.com/sign-up/) if you don't have one already.
```
contentful login
```
Step 3: Create a new space
```
contentful space create --name 'My space for the example app'
```
Step 4: [Seed](https://github.com/contentful/contentful-cli/tree/master/docs/space/seed) the new space with the example content model [`the-example-app`](https://github.com/contentful/content-models/tree/master/the-example-app). Replace the `SPACE_ID` with the id returned from the create command executed in step 3
```
contentful space seed -s '<SPACE_ID>' -t the-example-app
```
Step 5: Head to the Contentful web app's API section and grab `SPACE_ID`, `DELIVERY_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `PREVIEW_ACCESS_TOKEN`.

Step 6: Open `variables.env` and inject your credentials so it looks like this

```
NODE_ENV=development
CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID=<SPACE_ID>
CONTENTFUL_DELIVERY_TOKEN=<DELIVERY_ACCESS_TOKEN>
CONTENTFUL_PREVIEW_TOKEN=<PREVIEW_ACCESS_TOKEN>
PORT=3000
```

Step 7: To start the express server, run the following
```bash
npm run start:dev
```
Final Step:

Open [http://localhost:3000?editorial_features=enabled](http://localhost:3000?editorial_features=enabled) and take a look around. This URL flag adds an ‚ÄúEdit‚Äù button in the app on every editable piece of content which will take you back to Contentful web app where you can make changes. It also adds ‚ÄúDraft‚Äù and ‚ÄúPending Changes‚Äù status indicators to all content if relevant.

## Deploy to Heroku
You can also deploy this app to Heroku:

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)


## Use Docker
You can also run this app as a Docker container:

Step 1: Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/contentful/the-example-app.nodejs.git
```

Step 2: Build the Docker image

```bash
docker build -t the-example-app.nodejs .
```

Step 3: Run the Docker container locally:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 -d the-example-app.nodejs
```

If you created your own Contentful space, you can use it by overriding the following environment variables:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 \
  -e CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID=<SPACE_ID> \
  -e CONTENTFUL_DELIVERY_TOKEN=<DELIVERY_ACCESS_TOKEN> \
  -e CONTENTFUL_PREVIEW_TOKEN=<PREVIEW_ACCESS_TOKEN> \
  -d the-example-app.nodejs
```
